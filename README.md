# Brain Train - games for mental stimulation

Click [_here_](https://the-brain-train.web.app/) to train your brain!

---------------------

Test your reaction speed, train your memory, expand your vocabulary, up your typing speed, and improve your mouse aim, precision and speed!

The Brain Train is your hub for mental stimuli and semi-productive entertainment. Featuring 5 games, every game was designed to tickle the mind and get those brain juices flowing. The main idea for this project was to test React's capabilities and the power of state to produce a highly interactive web-page where every user input has a reaction.

- Simone: Test your memory! In this game, you will see four different coloured buttons. Starting the game, a random sequence will highlight each button. The aim of the game is to let Simone show you a sequence of colours, and repeat the sequence that you see. For each successful round, one colour gets added to the sequence. See how long you can last! 
- Proto-Type: A typing game heavily insipred by the popular typing speed tester monkey-type. Unlike many other type testers, Proto-Type aims to test your typing speed in a way that shows you what you're typing and the errors you've made dynamically, ***LIVE*** as you type. 
- New Word: Start with a random word, and think of a new word starting with the last letter! The chain keeps going as long as you can think of a new word to type, so think quick!
- Aim Train: It's target practice! Test how good you are with your mouse with Aim Train. A single target will be displayed on the screen, and on each click it's position will be randomised. This game keeps track of the speed at which you can click each target, and how precise you are with your clicks, as it tracks each click you miss. Your final score is then applied to a multiplier that is calculated depending on how quick and accurate you are.
- Reaction.js: A simple reaction speed tester. Click start, then at a random interval, the button will turn green. ***QUICK, CLICK!*** Your reaction speed is calculated based on how quickly you were able to click from when the button turned green. Simple. Go three rounds to get an average.
